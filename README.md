Cashier app in C#[CASHIER_UML.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17688723/CASHIER_UML.pdf)

Description:
This project is an object-oriented cash register system that I developed as part of my final examination assignment for the course 'OOP C#'. 

The system simulates cash handling in a grocery store and demonstrates my understanding of key programming principles, including object-oriented design, file handling, and user interaction. This project represents a comprehensive test of my ability to build a complete, functional application from scratch while incorporating advanced features and maintaining code quality.

Program Functionality :

- Product Registration: Products are stored with a product ID, name, price, and type (per kilo/unit).
  
- New Sale: Start a new customer transaction using commands like 300 2 (product ID and quantity).
  
- Payment: Complete the sale with the PAY command to generate and save the receipt in RECEIPT_yyyyMMdd.txt.
  
- Receipt Numbering: Receipt numbers increment automatically and continue between program runs.
  
- Admin Tool: Manage products, modify prices, and add new products.
  
- Campaign Prices: Handle time-limited campaigns that apply during specific dates and are displayed on receipts.
