## Description
The project is a console based grocery store cashier register system, that I have developed as part of my final examination assignment for the course 'OOP C#' at KYH liljeholmen, Stochkolm.


The program uses Autofac for dependency injection, interfaces for flexibility, factory design pattern, classes and methods. It follows S.O.L.I.D principles and clean code to ensure simplicity and maintainability.
