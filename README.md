Description
This project is an object-oriented cash register system that simulates cash handling in a grocery store. The system includes features for product management, receipt generation, and campaign price handling.

Functionality:

- Product Registration: Products are stored with a product ID, name, price, and type (per kilo/unit).
  
- New Sale: Start a new customer transaction using commands like 300 2 (product ID and quantity).
  
- Payment: Complete the sale with the PAY command to generate and save the receipt in RECEIPT_yyyyMMdd.txt.
  
- Receipt Numbering: Receipt numbers increment automatically and continue between program runs.
  
- Admin Tool: Manage products, modify prices, and add new products.
  
- Campaign Prices: Handle time-limited campaigns that apply during specific dates and are displayed on receipts.
