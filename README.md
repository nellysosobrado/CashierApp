## Description
This project is an object-oriented console cash register system that I developed as part of my final examination assignment for the course 'OOP C#'.

The system simulates cash handling in a grocery store and demonstrates my understanding of key programming principles, including object-oriented design, file handling, and user interaction. This project represents a comprehensive test of my ability to build a complete, functional application from scratch while incorporating advanced features and maintaining code quality.

Program Functionality :

- Product Registration
Store products with attributes: Product ID, Name, Price (per unit or kilo), and Type.

- New Sale
 add items to the cart using product ID and quantity (e.g., 300 2). View the running total.

- Payment and Receipt
Finalize transactions with PAY to generate and save a detailed receipt, including discounts and a unique receipt number.

- Receipt Numbering
Maintain sequential receipt numbering across program sessions.

- Admin Tools
Add, update, and manage products, prices, and inventory.

- Campaign Pricing
Apply time-limited discounts automatically, showing original price, discount, and final price on receipts.

Technical Highlights
Object-Oriented Design: Follows principles like Single Responsibility and Encapsulation.
File Handling: Stores receipts and product data persistently.
User Interaction: Simple, text-based interface with error feedback.
Advanced Features: Handles campaigns, validates input, and prevents errors.
Program Flow
Startup: Display options for sales or admin functions.
Sales: Add items to the cart, view totals, and complete sales with receipts.
Admin: Manage products, prices, and campaigns.
